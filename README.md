# Chat App

A mobile chat app built with Expo and React Native that saves data with Google Firebase, allowing users to share text, images, and their location.

Developed using Expo and written in React Native, the app is designed with assets provided within CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development program. Chat conversations are stored locally and with Firebase, which is also used for anonymous authentication. The chat interface and functionality comes from the Gifted Chat library.
